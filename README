Environment
===========

Instant's behaviour depened on following environment variables:

 - INSTANT_CACHE_DIR
 - INSTANT_ERROR_DIR 

     These options can override placement of default cache and error
     directories in ~/.instant/cache and ~/.instant/error.

 - INSTANT_CALL_METHOD

     Choose method for calling external programs (pkgconfig,
     swig, cmake, make). Available values:

       - 'subprocess.Popen'

           Uses pipes. Probably not OFED-fork safe. Default.

       - 'os.system'

           Uses temporary files. Probably OFED-fork safe.

       - 'commands.getstatusoutput'

           Uses pipes. Possibly OFED-fork safe on some machines.
           Does not work on Windows.
